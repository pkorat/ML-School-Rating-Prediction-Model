## Team Members:
* Parth Korat
* Geoff Pawlowski
* Amelia Corea
* Ashutosh Sawant

## Backgound
This project is the logical next step based on the Project 3 that was created by Team Bulldog. The link for the project is https://github.com/pkorat/San-Diego-County-Education-Equity-Analysis. In this project we had collected data from various sources and tried to analyze whether the Public Education System serve all Residents in San Diego County Equally?

For this project we are utilizing the data we collected during Project 3 and using the concepts of Machine Learning, we are trying to create a predition model which will help analyze the School Rating in a particular area based on the social-economical parameter
